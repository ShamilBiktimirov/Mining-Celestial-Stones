The MATLAB model at the date allows selecting prospective mining sites based on specific mission requirements and calculate launch windows for material transportation. 

To run simulation, please:
1. Run startup_AM.m file to initialize required constants and add folders to the project
2. Run Main_asteroid_mining.m to sort asteroids according to mission requirements and calculate launch windows for manterial transportaion from mining sites to prospective colony on Mars

Hint: if you would like to consider another group of asteroids you can prepare it in the Website https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi
